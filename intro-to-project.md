# kidoko-cfg-ck-data

This repository contains the project I created during Code First Girls' Coding Kickstarter course on Data and SQL (https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter/). This project is a management database that tracks students, instructors, degree courses, modules and faculties in a fictional university. Below is a description of each file in the repository:

## Kirsty Idoko - CFG Data Project Presentation
This is the PowerPoint file that introduces the project that I created.

## uni_tables_creation.sql
This SQL file is where I create the tables for the database and set the necessary primary and foreign keys.

## uni_functions_procedures.sql
This SQL file is where I create the stored functions and procedures for this database.

## uni_data_analysis.sql
This is where the analysis takes place.
